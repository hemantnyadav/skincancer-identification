# Skincancer-Identification
These are sample codes for using Deep learning for Skin cancer identification from (Diacom/Clinical Images)

1. fine tuning inception v3 for identificaition of skin cancer from Diacom Images
- This code(Skin_Cencer_inceptionv3_GPU.ipynb) uses inception v3 and publicaly aailable dataset from kaggle
- It train on GPU available on google colab
- accuracy is aroun 89%
